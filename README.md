# C Mini Projects
This repository contains a collection of small C programs Iâ€™ve written to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts.  
Each project is self contained, focusing on one skill at a time, such as working with input/output, arrays, conditionals, or simple algorithms.  

Purpose: to build a strong foundation before moving on to larger software engineering projects.
